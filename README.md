# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a software program which displays any function.

The program will have two methods of input. One will be a selection of example functions such as x^2, 1/x, and sin(x), which will be programmed as clickable buttons to view the functions. The second method of input will be a textbox, which will take any function input and display it.

If possible, I will attempt to make the viewing area of the cartesian coordinate system changeable, but this will be one of the later goals, if reached at all.
