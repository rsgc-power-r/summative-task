# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a software program which displays any function.

The program will have two methods of input. One will be a selection of example functions such as x^2, 1/x, and sin(x), which will be programmed as clickable buttons to view the functions. The second method of input will be a textbox, which will take any function input and display it.

If possible, I will attempt to make the viewing area of the cartesian coordinate system changeable, but this will be one of the later goals, if reached at all.

## Sub-goals

* Create a cartesian coordinate system as a basis for the functions being created
* Create "example function" buttons
* Implement example functions like x, x^2, x^3, 1/x, sin(x), etc
* Create a working textbox, that can take a String input
* Use the String input to graph the function
* Implement a changeable viewing area for the cartesian coordinate system

## Questions

* What (if anything â€“ although there is probably at least something) does the user need to know about what your program does?
* What (if anything) does the user need to know to operate your program (keystrokes, et cetera)?
* How does your program show evidence of your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation and inheritance?
* What evidence can you provide that your program is human-readable?
* For example, where have you used:
* descriptive function names
* meaningful variable names
* comments that describe the intention of a block of code
* What is the most important algorithm, or algorithm(s), in your program?
* That is, where is the "core idea" of your program?
* Explain how this works.
* How have you made your program easy to use?
* How have you made correct use of source control?
* For example, show that you have:
* made frequent commits
* kept commits "atomic" (i.e.: one accomplishment per commit, rather than a batch of things all committed at once)
* descriptive commit messages
